### README.md

My attempt to get the latest and greatest stable community version of openvas from source.  
Still need some work such as create users and gsa/gsad need TLS connection.

### TODO
* Separate container for GSA/GSAD
* Separate container for GVMD
* Separate container for REDIS server
* Separate container for OPENVAS Scanner
